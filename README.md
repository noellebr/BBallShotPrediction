# ShotPrediction
A project created for a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kobe-bryant-shot-selection) to predict whether Kobe Bryant was expected to make shots given various conditions. By Noelle Brown, Alexandra Norman, and Thejas Prasad.

* Languages used: Python and SAS

## Results
Our second Logistic Regression model provided us with the optimum log loss score of 0.6036 and the largest area under the curve. This model was created using a grid search technique in Python to identify the parameters that should be included in the model. Ultimately, this model does the best job in classifying and predicting whether or not the shots were made or missed. Further analysis could be done using additional models to attempt to minimize the log loss function and improve the misclassification rate. In the future, it would be interesting to extend this analysis to other NBA players to see if there are trends among players or teams.
